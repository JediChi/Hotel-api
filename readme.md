# Hotel Api

## This is a simple hotel api that creates rooms, fetches the room based on certain filters, updates the room and deletes room

## To keep things organized, the code was divided into several folders namely the db folder which stores the mongoose connections, the src folder which houses the models, routers and the main file, index.js

## The model folder contains the model of the room and room type.i.e. the structure of the room including name, prize and ids. The router folder stores the various routers of our code while the index.js file runs the program

## Requirements

1. Initialize npm in your folder
2. Install Mongoose
3. Install Express
4. Install nodemon
5. Install postman for testing the program(optional)
